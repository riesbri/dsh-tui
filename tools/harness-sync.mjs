/**
 * Propose the next adopted Harness generation, and nothing else.
 *
 * dshline adopts RELEASE GENERATIONS, not commits. Upstream marks each one the
 * same way every time — a published GitHub Release whose tag is `dsh-v<version>`
 * — and every revision this repository has ever adopted is exactly the commit
 * one of those tags names. That convention is the only upstream signal this
 * module reads. It deliberately does not read `master`, `latest`, `next`,
 * `alpha`, or any other channel: a branch head is not an adoption unit, and a
 * dist-tag is a distribution pointer whose movement says nothing about whether
 * a coherent generation exists. The alpha.5 episode is the whole argument —
 * npm's `alpha` moved most of a day before the release and tag appeared, and
 * only the latter is something `HARNESS_TARGET` can record.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do is decide whether dshline works against the
 * candidate. It cannot, and it must not try: the repository already owns that
 * answer in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, where `Harness target` checks the
 * revision out from source, links it, typechecks, and runs the capability
 * probes. Building a second opinion here would mean two compatibility
 * architectures disagreeing at 3am. So the output is a mechanical adoption
 * candidate; the existing pull-request checks are the verdict.
 *
 * ```text
 * harness-sync   is there a newer authoritative generation to propose?
 * ci             does dshline actually work against it?
 * ```
 *
 * Every external read is injectable, so the tests never touch the network.
 * @module tools/harness-sync

 *   record the tag object's own hash — a sha that exists, checks out as

 * - `target_commitish` is deliberately never used. It is usually the literal
 *   string `master`, which is a branch name, not the immutable revision the
 *   release was cut from.
 * - the candidate's own root manifest must declare exactly the version its tag
 *   encodes, the same coherence `harness-target.mjs --verify-source` proves in
 *   CI. A tag and a tree that disagree are not one generation.
 * - the currently adopted revision must be an ANCESTOR of the candidate. Git
 *   ancestry, not version ordering: a rewritten, reverted, or parallel release
 *   history is exactly the case where semver would happily walk dshline
