# @riesbri/dsh-tui

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 786b993: Add a Harness-native Sessions browser. `/sessions` and `--resume` now open the
  same bounded overlay: it lists the `ctx.sessionQuery` corpus newest first with
  batched folded titles, filters as you type over titles, workspaces, and ids, and
  hands the same words to the engine's full-text surface on `tab` to search what
  sessions said — degrading to filtering when a deployment's backend implements no
  content search. The selected row shows its workspace, event count, last activity,
  lineage, and id, and short badges mark the open session, a live one, a delegated
  child, and a fork.
  
  Reopening now works from inside a running window. It retires the current agent
  through the owned `AgentHandle` disposer and resumes the chosen session with
  `ctx.agents.resume`, appending the replayed transcript into native scrollback
  without rewriting anything already committed. It refuses, naming the reason, when
  a turn is running, when jobs or subagents are still attached to the session being
  left, when the target is already live, or when it has no persisted log. A resume
  that fails anyway reports Harness's reason and reopens the browser rather than
  ending the process or substituting a session nobody asked for.
