/**
 * Semantic roles, and the active palette that resolves them to SGR parameters.
 *
 * The indirection exists because a colour name at a call site is not a decision
 * anyone can revisit later. `style(text, 'red')` is written identically for a
 * failed tool and for a removed line of a diff, so no palette could ever move
 * one without moving the other. A ROLE says what a piece of text is; a PALETTE
 * says what that looks like. Only the second is a theme's to choose.
 *
 * **This module owns the mechanism, not the vocabulary.** The roles declared
 * here are the ones this package draws itself — markdown structure and generic
 * emphasis — because rendering markdown is a renderer capability. Everything a
 * frontend means by a colour, a reply or a tool card or context pressure, is
 * that frontend's domain: it adds those roles by augmenting {@link PaletteRoles}
 * from its own package. That keeps this one ignorant of agents, sessions, and
 * tools, which is the same rule that keeps it free of dependencies.
 *
 * The active palette is process-global, for the reason raw mode is: there is one
 * terminal. It follows the same rule too — installing one returns the disposer
 * that puts the previous one back, and calling that disposer twice is safe.
 * @module @dshline/renderer/theme
