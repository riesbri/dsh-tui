## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 30fb9dd: Bound the shared picker to the terminal, and let it be searched when it is long.
  
  `/model` over a gateway route offers whatever the provider advertises, which for
  OpenRouter or opencode is hundreds of models. The picker drew a row per choice,
  so it handed `Screen` a live region taller than the screen — and rows that have
  scrolled off cannot be reached or erased, which left duplicates in real
  scrollback and could clear output the picker never owned. The list is now a
  viewport over its rows, exactly as Work, Sessions, and Connect are.
  
  Past twelve choices it also grows a query box and filters as you type, with a
  counter that reports what the query left and what was offered separately. Below
  that nothing changes: a three-choice approval spends no row on a search box and
  typed characters stay meaningless there. A terminal too small to hold the frame
  now falls back to the selected choice and its keys rather than an unanswerable
  list, because an approval can arrive in any geometry.
  
  `/model`'s rows are now spelled `provider/model` — the argument the command
  accepts — with the provider's own display name under the selection when it adds
  something beyond the id. Filtering matches the label, so what you type is what
  you can see.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e28e676: Add `/connect`, a Harness-native provider configuration browser.
  
  `/model` chooses among models that already exist; `/connect` is how a model comes
  to exist. It joins four Harness surfaces — the configurable-provider directory
  and registered routes from `ctx.llm`, the user-settings document through
  `ctx.settings`, credential presence through `ctx.credentials`, and the login
  flows on `ctx.authorization` — into one bounded overlay, and configures them
  through the seam that owns each.
  
  There is no provider list and no login protocol in this frontend. A route is
  offered because a mounted adapter declared it configurable, a profile's
  credential field is found by its schemastery `credential-ref` role rather than
  by a field name, and an authorization flow is rendered from the seam's neutral
  notice and prompt vocabulary, so a surface that renders one flow renders all of
  them. A sign-in page and device code are committed to native scrollback, where
  they can be selected and copied.
  
  Because both write the same settings namespace and the same credential
  reference, a change made here is visible on the official web Models page and the
  other way round, and `/model` sees a newly activated route's models with no
  further step.
  
  Closing the browser withdraws any sign-in it started, including one waiting on a
  browser callback with no prompt on screen, so nothing from a withdrawn attempt
  surfaces afterwards.
  
  The renderer gains `ctrl-r` in its key tables, which the browser uses to ask
  Harness again, and `tailToWidth`, the suffix twin of `truncateToWidth` that
  keeps an input field's newest characters in view.
