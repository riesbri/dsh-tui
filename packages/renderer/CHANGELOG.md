## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e28e676: Add `/connect`, a Harness-native provider configuration browser.
  
  `/model` chooses among models that already exist; `/connect` is how a model comes
  to exist. It joins four Harness surfaces — the configurable-provider directory
  and registered routes from `ctx.llm`, the user-settings document through
  `ctx.settings`, credential presence through `ctx.credentials`, and the login
  flows on `ctx.authorization` — into one bounded overlay, and configures them
  through the seam that owns each.
  
  There is no provider list and no login protocol in this frontend. A route is
  offered because a mounted adapter declared it configurable, a profile's
  credential field is found by its schemastery `credential-ref` role rather than
  by a field name, and an authorization flow is rendered from the seam's neutral
  notice and prompt vocabulary, so a surface that renders one flow renders all of
  them. A sign-in page and device code are committed to native scrollback, where
  they can be selected and copied.
  
  Because both write the same settings namespace and the same credential
  reference, a change made here is visible on the official web Models page and the
  other way round, and `/model` sees a newly activated route's models with no
  further step.
  
  Closing the browser withdraws any sign-in it started, including one waiting on a
  browser callback with no prompt on screen, so nothing from a withdrawn attempt
  surfaces afterwards.
  
  The renderer gains `ctrl-r` in its key tables, which the browser uses to ask
  Harness again, and `tailToWidth`, the suffix twin of `truncateToWidth` that
  keeps an input field's newest characters in view.
