/**
 * The approval answerer.

 * `ctx.approval` is a waterfall with many possible answerers, so this listener

 * agent's approvals, including a subagent's.
 *
 * The abort check is synchronous and deliberate: dispatch rides a microtask, so
 * an abort landing in that window would leave a prompt on screen for a request
 * that has already settled `'cancelled'`, and nothing would ever dismiss it.
