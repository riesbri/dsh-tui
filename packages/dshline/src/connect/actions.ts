 * keeps carrying references rather than values and stays safe to sync and to
 * render. And a settings write is a path op carrying the revision the row was
 * read at, so a concurrent edit — a second terminal, the web Models page, or a
 * hand-edited `settings.yaml` — is refused instead of being overwritten.
 *
 * Nothing here decides whether an action should be OFFERED; {@link rowActions}
 * does, from the same facts. These functions assume the offer was made and
