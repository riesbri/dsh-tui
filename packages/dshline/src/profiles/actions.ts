/**
 * Running one `dsh plugin --profile <name> …` invocation from the terminal.
 *
 * This is the whole mutation surface of `/profiles`, and it is deliberately a
 * forwarder rather than an implementation. Harness owns profile package
 * lifecycle in one place — `apps/cli/src/plugin.ts` — which initializes the
 * profile directory if it is new, runs pnpm inside it, and then reconciles
 * `dsh.profile.bundles` against the INSTALLED state (so a package that gained
 * its `dsh.bundle` declaration in a newer version joins the layer stack on
 * update). Reproducing any part of that here would be a second installer whose
 * idea of the bundle list drifts from the real one the moment either changes.
 *
 * There is no Harness service for profile mutation: `runPlugin` lives in the
 * CLI app, not in a mounted plugin, and nothing publishes it into a context.
 * So the operation still goes through Harness's own `dsh` executable, resolved
 * by `../launcher.ts` the same four ways `bin/dshline.mjs` resolves it. Process
 * ownership is a separate concern, though, and belongs to `ctx.subprocess`:
 * that seam owns executable lookup, environment policy, process trees, and
 * cross-platform termination for every Harness consumer.
 *
 * Four things this module does that the CLI does not, all because a TUI owns
 * the terminal and a person is waiting:
 *
 * ```
 * stdio is PIPED, never inherited   `dsh plugin` uses stdio:'inherit'; a child
 *                                   writing pnpm progress straight into a
 *                                   screen this process is painting would
 *                                   corrupt the live region
 * output is a ROLLING tail          pnpm can emit megabytes; only the last few
 *                                   lines are ever held, so a long install
 *                                   cannot grow this process's memory with
 *                                   text nobody will read
 * the timeout SETTLES               the subprocess seam escalates termination;
 *                                   this caller still classifies its own
 *                                   deadline and stops waiting at a hard bound
 * specs are REDACTED for display    a package spec can carry a token in a URL;
 *                                   it is passed to the launcher verbatim and
 *                                   never written to the transcript as-is
