/**
 * Reading Harness's own profile machinery: which profiles exist, which one
 * this process booted, and what each one composes.
 *
 * A Harness PROFILE is the layer above a preset. `dsh --profile <name>` boots
 * `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>`, whose `package.json` carries the ordered
 * `dsh.profile.bundles` list; each bundle is an npm package declaring
 * `dsh.bundle.patch`, and the Host's composition is those patch layers applied
 * in order, then the profile's own `cordis.patch.yml`. Profiles PROVIDE
 * capabilities to the Host; presets (`/plugins`) EXPOSE them to an agent.
 *
 * Two Harness-owned facts are read here and nothing else is derived:
 *
 * ```
 * ctx.dshHomePath('profiles')   the profiles root — Harness's own home-path
 *                               service, provided by `boot()` before any entry
 *                               mounts, so this is the same directory the
 *                               launcher resolved
 * ctx.baseUrl                   the booted profile's own directory — `boot()`
 *                               anchors it at `dirname(rootConfigPath)`, and
 *                               the profile launcher passes
 *                               `<profileDir>/cordis.yml`, so this IS which
 *                               profile is running
 * ```
 *
 * Deliberately NOT importing `@deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot`, even though it
 * exports `resolveProfileDir`/`readProfileManifest`/`PROFILES_DIR`. That
 * package's own peer list is nine entries (four `cordis-plugin-*`,
 * `dsh-launch-environment`, `dsh-invariants`, `dsh-home-paths`,
 * `dsh-system-prompt`, `cordis`), and declaring them here would print
 * unmet-peer warnings for every profile that composes a frontend without the
 * launcher's boot graph — for helpers that, on the read side, amount to a
 * `JSON.parse` of a documented manifest. What this module reuses instead is
 * the SERVICE (`ctx.dshHomePath`) and the FORMAT, with every borrowed constant
 * named against its upstream definition below. Nothing here re-implements
 * bundle module resolution: the two directories a bundle can be installed in
 * are read in the order `profile.ts`'s own header documents, and a bundle
 * found in neither simply reports no version rather than being resolved by
 * some other route.
 *
 * Read-only by construction. Every mutation goes through `actions.ts`, which
 * shells out to `dsh plugin` — Harness's own package lifecycle — rather than
 * writing a manifest from here.
